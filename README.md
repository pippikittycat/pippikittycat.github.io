# Personal Website 🌐

This is my personal website project — a work in progress that I’m actively building and improving.  
The site serves as both a sandbox for experimenting with JavaScript/CSS/HTML features and as the foundation for my portfolio.

## ✅ Current Accomplishments

- **Core structure of the website** is in place (homepage, footer, navigation, and layout foundations).  
- **Settings page (early version)** that applies effects globally and persists changes locally in the browser.  
- **Animations**: implemented a variety of JavaScript and CSS-driven animations for interactivity and polish.  
- **Accessibility**: passes most accessibility audits (especially screen readers), though there’s still room for refinement.

## 🔧 Work in Progress / Planned Features

- **Responsive design**: improve resizing and scaling for different devices and screen sizes.  
- **Settings page expansion**: make all settings truly global across pages, not just on the homepage/settings page.  
- **Background videos**: smooth out transitions to avoid jarring cuts.  
- **Content box adjustments**: increase size and font for easier readability.
- **Dark mode and high contrast mode**: it is in the bare bones right now, soon to be developed further. 
- **Additional pages**:  
  - Portfolio  
  - Current Projects  
  - Social Media links
  - Blogs
  - Resumes
  - Employment History
  - (and more as the site evolves)

## 🚧 Status

This project is very much **a work in progress**.  
The homepage is at a point where it demonstrates what I’ve built so far, but the full site and features are still under development.  

I’m continuously experimenting with design choices, accessibility improvements, and interactive features to make the site more polished and user-friendly.

## 📌 Goals

- Showcase projects and work in a clean, accessible, and interactive way.  
- Provide user customization options through the settings page.  
- Build a maintainable, responsive site that adapts to different devices.

## 🙌 Notes

- This site is intended as both a portfolio and a playground for testing new front-end techniques.  
- Contributions, suggestions, or accessibility feedback are welcome!
